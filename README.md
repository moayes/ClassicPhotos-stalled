=====================

A repository for the sample stalled project of 'How To Use NSOperations and NSOperationQueues' tutorial.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use concurrency in iOS applications! You’ll first create an app that doesn’t use multithreading at all, so it will appear very sluggish and unresponsive. Then you will rework the application to add concurrent operations and — hopefully — provide a more responsive interface to the user!
